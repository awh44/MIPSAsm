Lab 1: Introduction to SPIM
email: awh44@drexel.edu

The program submitted for this lab, power.asm, is a simple MIPS assembly
program which takes two inputs (referred to as "x" and "y"), and computes
the value of one to the power of the other, i.e., x^y, and outputs it to the
screen. It was written using Notepad++ on Windows 7, and I tested it with
the 9.1.9 version of QtSpim on Windows.

There is nothing special about running the program. After loading the
program into SPIM and running it, simply enter the base and power inputs as
direcred.

There are two minor assumptions about the input: first, that the second input,
"y", will be nonnegative (i.e., >= 0); second, the combination of x and y
will not cause an overflow. If the calculated value is too large for 32
bits, the program may experience an error or return an incorrect value.

I tested several different cases of x^y, including special cases such as
exponents of zero or negative bases, and they all performed as expected.
Specific test cases are listed below:
x^0, for x = 2, 7; always returned 1
1^2 = 1^5 = 1
2^3 = 8
(-2)^3 = -8
(-2)^4 = 16
7^7 = 823543
8^6 = 262144

Based on these test cases, as well as a few other undocumented ones, the
program appears to be working fine.

My experience with completing the project was very educational. When
originally tracing through the program I found it tedious and confusing.
However, after doing more reading and returning to it at a later date, it
became much clearer, and I very easily understood what each instruction did.
Once I understood the instructions, which the trace certainly helped with,
writing the power program became very simple, as it only required a few
tweaks to the original sum program.

I do not think there need to be any major changes made to this lab for the
benefit of future students. It's fairly effective in teaching about the
working of MIPS and SPIM.
